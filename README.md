# AI-Story-Generator
Project Overview

This project implements an automated story generator using Prolog, a logic programming language. The system generates narratives based on user inputs by defining rules for story progression, character actions, and state transitions.


Key Features
Story Templates: Includes a treasure hunt adventure, Cinderella, and a vacation story.
Logic Rules: Utilizes Prolog’s declarative nature to create coherent and immersive stories.
Dynamic Storytelling: User inputs drive the narrative, with characters moving between locations and interacting with objects.
Implementation Details
Facts and Rules: Defined to represent spatial relationships, character states, and interactions.
Story Generation: Abstract user actions are transformed into detailed story events, ensuring consistency and logical flow.
Prolog Code: Includes pathfinding, state updates, and storytelling logic to bring narratives to life.
Results
The generated stories are engaging, logically coherent, and demonstrate Prolog’s potential in narrative generation. The project serves as a foundation for further exploration into dynamic and interactive storytelling.
